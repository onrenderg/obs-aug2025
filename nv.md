Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking

Thoughtfor 3s

The user wants me to refactor the PointToPointVcPage.xaml file but specifically warns me not to mess with the card click function. Let me read the full file first to understand the structure and identify any click handlers.

I can see the file has a ListView with ItemTapped="listView_multipointvc_ItemTapped" - this is the card click function the user is warning me not to mess with. I'll keep that intact. Let me refactor:

1. Navigation - nested StackLayout to HorizontalStackLayout
2. Main layout - StackLayout to Grid with proper rows
3. Headers - remove hardcoded text
4. Filter Grid - already has Grid, just clean up and use inline definitions
5. ListView - keep the ItemTapped handler intact, but modernize the Frame to Border
